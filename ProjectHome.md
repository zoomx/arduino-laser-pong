An Arduino controls a self-made laser projector that uses a laser, mirrors, and stepper motors. I programmed the Arduino to have the projector display a clock or play Pong.

The code is licensed under the MIT license, so feel free to use it in your project. If it's a commercial project, go right ahead - just let me know at alvin dot armea at gmail.

More on the hardware later.
